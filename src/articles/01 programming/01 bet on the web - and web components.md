# bet on the web - and web components

### 2018-08-02

I don't use frameworks, so React appeals to me. I like how it organizes ideas.
I like its top-down, one-way flow of data. But I also think some of its
usefulness is debatable. It has a big island of tooling that's going in a
very different direction than the rest of the web. Like Coffeescript or jQuery,
in 5 years it will probably inspire standards bodies with its best features.

I also like Web Components, they're great because they offer true, native
encapsulation &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; no hacks. They are mostly the result of
consensus among the web's working groups. They're pretty awkward, like most of
the web's native APIs &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; but a foundation to build on.

I'd like to introduce Tonic. It's about 125 lines of code. It's much less
opinionated than React. It shares some of the same goals; though its main goal
is to provide the *minimum* of what is needed to organize code, the flow of
data and create component based architecture. Most importantly, it's built on
the platform of the future, the web.

You can find the project [here][0] on Github.
