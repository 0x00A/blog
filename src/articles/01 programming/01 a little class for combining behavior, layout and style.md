# a little class for combining behavior, layout and style

### 2019-04-30

I like some of what React offers. I also think it's bloated, over-hyped and
its philosophy changes much too frequently.

I like Web Components, they're great because they offer true, native
encapsulation &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; without hacks. They are mostly the result of
consensus among the web's working groups. But they have an awkward API, like
any API that is designed by consensus.

Tonic is about 250 lines of code. It combines some of the goals and ideas of
React and Web Components. It works in all browsers. Its intented to provide the
*minimum* of what is needed to organize application code, the flow of data and
accommodate component based architecture.

You can find the core library [here][1] and a collection of components [here][2]
on Github.
